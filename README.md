# Asteroids-Check
An excel template to check your $ROIDS and $ATOM balances in your addresses
## Usage
1. Open the ROIDS.xltx with Excel
2. Filled your addresses in
3. Click the `Check ROIDS` button <br />

The balances of your `$ROIDS/$ATOM in your addresses` and the balances of `$ROIDS you listed in the market` will be auto filled in.<br />

※ Inital $ROIDS balances need you fill in manually.<br />
※ Excel in old version may not be able to use the `Office Scripts`.<br />
※ The ROIDS.ts has been added to the table so you don't need to use it generally, just for reference.
